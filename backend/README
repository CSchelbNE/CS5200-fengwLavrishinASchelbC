This is a full-stack web application hosted locally.

The program was written and tested in PyCharm but any IDE which allows for javascript (React)
and backend python concurrently (FastAPI) should suffice.

The program requires that python3 and node.js. Pip is used to handle the backend dependencies and
npm is used to handle the frontend dependencies. If python3 needs to be installed allow
the installer to download pip as well.

NodeJS installer: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Python3 installer: https://www.python.org/downloads/


Execution steps:
1: Open a terminal and go to the folder /CS5200-fengwLavrishinASchelbC/
From here run the command "npm install" to pull the dependencies from package.json


2: Move to /CS5200-fengwLavrishinASchelbC/backend and run the command:
windows:    py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
unix:     python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

This should pull all the necessary dependencies.

3: Ensure your localhost MySQL server is booted.

4: Open two terminals in the IDE:

5: in the first terminal go to/CS5200-fengwLavrishinASchelbC/backend and run the command:
windows:    py main.py
unix:     python3 main.py

It should prompt you for your MySQL localhost's username/password.
If the auth is successful the backend server will boot:
Database connection was successful
INFO:     Started server process [25847]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://localhost:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)


6: In the second terminal go to the folder /CS5200-fengwLavrishinASchelbC/ run the command:
npm start

This should open a browser automatically
If it does not, you can manually open the application in a browser at the url http://localhost:3000/

Finished: At this point the application should run properly and you'll see a login screen.
